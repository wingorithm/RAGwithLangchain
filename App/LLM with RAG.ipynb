Comparison rates and examples are based on a $30,000 unsecured fixed rate loan over 5 years:\\n\\nInterest rates range from 8.50%3 p.a.\\xa0to 20.50% p.a. (comparison rate from 9.53% p.a. to 21.39% p.a.).\\xa0The estimated total amount payable including fees is between $37,830 and $49,091\\nThe representative rate is 16.00%4 p.a.\\xa0(16.94% p.a. comparison Rate), based on this representative rate the estimated total amount payable including fees is $44,673\\n\\n3 Interest rates at the lower end of our range, for example\\xa08.50% p.a. (comparison rate 9.53%\\xa0p.a.), may be offered to customers with an excellent credit history.\\nAn excellent credit history is determined by, among other things, paying your bills and making loan repayments on or ahead of time, being disciplined with your credit applications, and not overextending yourself financially.\\n4 At least half of our customers will receive the representative rate or lower. It may not be the actual rate you receive.\\nWARNING: This comparison rate applies only to the example or examples given. Different amounts and terms will result in different comparison rates.

To apply, you’ll need access to NetBank or the CommBank app and you must have an eligible CommBank transaction account.\\n\\n\\n                            What is an eligible CommBank transaction account for repayments?\\n                            \\n\\nYou must have a linked CommBank transaction account for repayments. Eligible CommBank transaction accounts include:\\n\\nCash Investment Account\\nCash Management Call Account\\nComplete Access\\nEveryday Offset\\nPensioners Security Account\\nPrivate Banking Account\\nSmart Access\\nStreamline Basic Account\\n\\n\\n                            What if I’m not an existing CommBank customer?\\n                            \\n\\nIf you’re not an existing CommBank customer and you’d like to apply for InstalPay, simply visit your nearest branch to get set up. Applications for InstalPay are subject to credit approval.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n                            Why are there no loan costs? \\n                            \\n\\nCommBank is remunerated for InstalPay via a merchant service fee, a transaction fee that each merchant pays CommBank when a customer makes a purchase using InstalPay. Under our agreement with merchants, merchants are not able to pass this fee on to customers. This means CommBank can offer InstalPay to customers with no interest and no upfront or monthly account fees.\\nThere are late fees if you don’t repay on time, and standard fees apply to your linked repayment account.\\n\\n\\n                            How are the monthly repayments calculated? \\n                            \\n\\nYour monthly repayment is simply the loan amount divided by the loan term. You pay no interest and no monthly or annual fees. For example: If you borrow $10,000 over a two-year loan term, your monthly repayment is $10,000 divided by 24 months = $416.67 (rounded up). It’s that simple.\\n\\n\\n                            Can I make extra repayments?\\n                            \\n\\nYes, you can make extra repayments or pay out your loan early without charge or penalty anytime via NetBank or the CommBank. Extra repayments aren’t available for redraw and will reduce your monthly repayment obligation for future payments.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n                            Something went wrong in my application – how do I re-apply for InstalPay?\\n                            \\n\\nYou can always resume your application for InstalPay via NetBank under ‘My applications’. Otherwise, you can return to the merchant checkout, select InstalPay and start the application again.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n                            How is payment for my purchase made?\\n                            \\n\\nIf approved, we’ll pay the merchant directly the amount of your purchase and then debit your InstalPay loan account. You’ll then pay us what you owe in monthly instalments over the agreed term.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n                            What do I do if my loan is unsuccessful? \\n                            \\n\\nWe’ll let you know on the spot. At this point you’ll be redirected back to the merchant checkout page, where you can select another payment option if you wish to proceed with your purchase.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n                            What if something goes wrong with the products I’ve bought using InstalPay?\\n                            \\n\\nIf you have any questions or concerns regarding the goods and services you buy using InstalPay, you’ll need to contact the merchant directly. Using InstalPay to pay for your purchase won’t affect any rights you may have under applicable consumer protection laws. If you have concerns related to your InstalPay application or loan account, contact us.\\nThings you should know\\n\\n\\n* Loan term extensions are not available. A longer term means your repayments will be smaller. And there's no charge for making extra repayments or paying out early.\\nInstalPay has a maximum loan term of five years.

If you have a home loan with us, you may be eligible for a CommBank Green Loan attached to your existing home loan, which has a 10-year term.\\nInstalPay is only available online.

That way, the only thing you need to do is make sure there’s enough money in your account to cover each repayment.\\nTo set up direct debit, simply visit your local branch.\\n\\n\\nMake extra repayments when you can\\n\\n\\nYou can reduce the life of your loan by paying more than the minimum repayment amount. Every bit extra you put into you loan helps to reduce the balance and the amount of interest you need to pay.\\nBut with certain loans, you may incur additional costs if you repay more than your annual limit or pay off your loan early.\\n\\n\\nTell me more\\n\\n\\nTake advantage of the redraw facility\\n\\n\\nIf you have a Variable Rate Loan, any additional repayments you make will reduce the balance of your loan faster.

Any money you put into your Everyday Offset reduces the balance on which we charge interest. This means you’ll only be paying interest on the difference. \\nThe Everyday Offset account must be in the same name(s) as the borrowers on the home loan and you can open an Everyday Offset account in your name or jointly with your co-borrower(s).
