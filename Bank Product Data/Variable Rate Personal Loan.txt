Unsecured Variable Rate Personal Loan interest rate ranges and the representative rate are set out below. Comparison rates and examples are based on a $30,000 unsecured variable rate loan over 5 years:

Interest rates range from 8.50%2 p.a. to 20.50% p.a. (comparison rate from 9.89% p.a. to 21.79% p.a.). The estimated total amount payable including fees is between $38,080 and $49,341
The representative rate is 16.00%3 p.a. (17.32% p.a. comparison Rate), based on this representative rate the estimated total amount payable including fees is $44,923

2 Interest rates at the lower end of our range, for example 8.50% p.a. (comparison rate 9.89% p.a.), may be offered to customers with an excellent credit history.
An excellent credit history is determined by, among other things, paying your bills and making loan repayments on or ahead of time, being disciplined with your credit applications, and not overextending yourself financially.
Actions which can negatively impact your credit history include missing bill or loan repayments, defaulting on your credit facility, or making a large number of credit applications in a short period of time. You can find out more about how your credit score is calculated and tips for improving your credit score at our Credit Score Information Hub.
3 At least half of our customers will receive the representative rate or lower. It may not be the actual rate you receive.
WARNING: This comparison rate applies only to the example or examples given. Different amounts and terms will result in different comparison rates. Costs such as redraw fees or early repayment fees, and cost savings such as fee waivers, are not included in the comparison rate but may influence the cost of the loan.
