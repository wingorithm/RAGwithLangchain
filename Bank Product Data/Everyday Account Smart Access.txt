You deposit at least $2,000 per month (excludes Bank-initiated transactions), or
You’re under 30 years of age, or
You meet other criteria1


$0 ATM withdrawal fee

Charges apply for International transactions 
See all rates and fees for overseas transactions.5


Interest rate
This account doesn't earn interest. To earn interest on your savings, you can easily open an online savings account linked to your CommBank bank account when opening your account, or at a later date.


Overdraw fee
$15 fee may apply when a payment you make goes through which overdraws on your account balance or exceeds its agreed overdraft limit on a given day. You can only incur one overdraw fee per account per day, regardless of the number of transactions or payments you make on that day.6
You can avoid this fee by switching off the overdraw feature. Simply log on to the CommBank app or NetBank and opt out via the overdrawing preferences located in account settings. You can also give us a call or visit your nearest branch.


Dishonour fee
$5 fee may apply if there are insufficient available funds to make your scheduled payment. We will only charge this fee after 5 unsuccessful attempts over 5 days7, giving you time to top up your account balance.
You can avoid this fee by ensuring you have sufficient funds available within the 5 days and by checking your balance regularly to ensure you have sufficient funds.

Frequently asked questions


                            Can I begin using my bank account immediately?
                            

Once we’ve verified your identity, you can start banking straight away.
You'll need to complete your ID verification within 20 days of opening your account, or your account may automatically close. If you miss this timing, you can reapply at any CommBank branch.
While your Debit Mastercard is on its way to you, download the CommBank app or log on to NetBank to:

Withdraw money from CommBank ATMs using Cardless Cash10
Pay friends using just their mobile number11


                            What ID documents do I need to verify my account?
                            

Have your Australian driver’s licence, Proof of Age card (issued by an Australian state or territory), passport, Medicare card, or Australian birth certificate handy.
Having more than one form of ID will improve your chances of passing the online ID check. 
You can complete your ID check in-branch too – you’ll just need to bring these documents.


                            Should I provide my Tax File information?
                            

Each time you open an account that may pay interest, we give you the option to provide your TFN, ABN or TFN Exemption.
You don't have to provide these, but if the account earns interest, CommBank is legally required to withhold tax from any interest earned above a certain threshold.
We’ll also ask you about your tax residency (a Government requirement).

You may also be eligible for a different monthly account fee exemption if you have an aged, disability or war veterans’ pension deposited in your account, have a balance of $50,000 or more in eligible contributing accounts, are reliant on over the counter services because of a disability or have an eligible home loan. Find out more about rates and fees.

2The CommBank Yello Cashback Offers program (‘CommBank Yello Cashback Offers’) rewards you with cashback after you activate (where required) an offer presented to you via the CommBank app and you make a purchase in accordance with the Terms and Conditions of that offer. Cashback is typically received within 14 business days of a qualifying purchase, but in some cases may take longer. If you are not already enrolled, you can enrol if you are at least 18 years old, hold an eligible CommBank credit Mastercard or debit Mastercard, Business credit Mastercard or StepPay digital card, and meet the ‘Base eligibility criteria’ in the ‘CommBank Yello Terms and Conditions’ (latest version available on our website at commbank.com.au) (‘CommBank Yello’). Your participation in CommBank Yello Cashback Offers is governed by the full Terms and Conditions available in the CommBank app.
3 We predict your bills based on patterns in your transactions, how much you pay and when. We may not predict all of your bills. Our prediction date and amounts may be different from your actual bill. Check your bills and due dates to avoid late fees or paying an incorrect amount. See 'Bills and payments' in the CommBank app Terms and Conditions for full details.
4 Independent ATM providers may charge a withdrawal fee.
5 This includes purchases made in Australia (for example online), where the merchant is located overseas or the financial institution or entity processing the transaction is located overseas.
6 The overdraw fee is usually charged the next calendar day.
The account can be overdrawn to cover any accidental or unplanned shortfall in funds to meet a payment. This feature is only available for customers over 18. Customers can also set up Overdrawn Account alerts via NetBank or the CommBank App. These alerts are sent as CommBank App push notifications or SMS.
7 Attempts will generally be on consecutive business days. For NetBank scheduled payments, we will aim to make the first attempt on the day your scheduled payment is due, and another 4 attempts on subsequent business days.
8 Cardless cash is available from any CommBank ATM. Withdrawals are limited to a total of $500 per day. CommBank app, NetBank, NetCode and account access required. Full conditions on app.
9 The recipient needs to have an Australian bank account (with BSB and account number) and have an active mobile phone number.
The CommBank app is free to download however your mobile network provider charges you for accessing data on your phone. Find out about the minimum operating system requirements on the CommBank app page. Terms and conditions are available in the app. NetBank access with NetCode SMS is required.
