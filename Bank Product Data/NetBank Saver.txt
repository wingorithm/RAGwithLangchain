Things you should know


1 Open a NetBank Saver for the first time from 16 November 2023 and you’ll receive a variable introductory interest rate for the first 5 months after account opening. The variable introductory rate is currently 5.10% p.a., which includes a fixed bonus margin of 2.75% p.a. above the NetBank Saver standard variable rate, currently 2.35% p.a. At the end of the introductory rate period the NetBank Saver standard variable rate applicable at that time will apply. This introductory rate offer is available for a limited time only and the Bank reserves the right to terminate this offer at any time. The variable introductory interest rate will not apply to NetBank Saver accounts which are jointly owned where one of the account holders has previously held a NetBank Saver account.
2 Requires a GoalSaver or NetBank Saver in your name only.
3 Eligible CommBank transaction account can be Smart Access, Complete Access, Everyday Offset, Pensioner Security or Streamline Basic account in the same name as your NetBank Saver account. If you don’t have an existing eligible transaction account, we will open a Smart Access account under the same name as your NetBank Saver. 
4 If you’re eligible, you can ask us instead to open a Streamline Basic account – which has no monthly account fees. You can open a Streamline Basic account if you hold an Australian Government issued Commonwealth Seniors Health card, Pensioner Concession card, or a Health Care card. To open a Streamline Basic and link this to your NetBank Saver, visit a branch. Find out more here.
