Ways to send money overseas


Send to someone’s mobile number – it’s quick, easy and secure
Send to someone’s international bank account - you’ll need their full name, account name and home address, account number or International Bank Account Number (IBAN) and the SWIFT or Bank Identification Code (BIC) of their bank

Tip: Convert your payment into foreign currency and send from NetBank or the CommBank app to lock in the exchange rate and pay a lower transfer fee.















Your checklist






Before you send money

Ask whoever you’re sending money to for their mobile number or bank details
Choose which CommBank account to transfer the money from
Check your transfer limit. You can increase it in NetBank or the CommBank app and make sure you’re registered for Netcode SMS
Check the exchange rate to calculate your transfer amount
Always double-check you’ve entered the correct information before you confirm the transfer




Once your money is sent

It generally takes 3 business days for the payment to reach the recipient but may take longer depending on the recipient’s country and bank

Transfers made on a weekend, a public/bank holiday or after the currency cut-off time will be processed the following business day
You can trace, amend or cancel an IMT














How to send an IMT






Send money overseas from the CommBank app using just a mobile number 
Your recipient collects a payment made using their mobile number from CommBank Payment Collections.

They simply need to enter the collection code, their mobile number, banking and personal details then tap ‘Collect payment’. They can also store their details so they don’t need to collect future payments (we’ll also verify some details via SMS).




Send to an account number using NetBank or the CommBank app

Log on to NetBank > choose Transfers and BPAY > International Money Transfer.
Or log on to the CommBank app > Pay Someone > Overseas transfer (to pay someone in your international address book) or “+” (to pay a new recipient)
Choose the destination country
Add the recipient’s details
Double-check the details you’ve entered are correct




In branch
You can also send money overseas at your nearest branch. It’s cheaper and quicker to make a transfer online or using the CommBank app though.
