FAQs


                            Who is eligible for InstalPay?
                            

InstalPay is available to existing CommBank customers who meet our eligibility criteria and who satisfy credit assessments. To apply, you’ll need access to NetBank or the CommBank app and you must have an eligible CommBank transaction account.


                            What is an eligible CommBank transaction account for repayments?
                            

You must have a linked CommBank transaction account for repayments. Eligible CommBank transaction accounts include:

Cash Investment Account
Cash Management Call Account
Complete Access
Everyday Offset
Pensioners Security Account
Private Banking Account
Smart Access
Streamline Basic Account


                            What if I’m not an existing CommBank customer?
                            

If you’re not an existing CommBank customer and you’d like to apply for InstalPay, simply visit your nearest branch to get set up. Applications for InstalPay are subject to credit approval. 


                            Why are there no loan costs? 
                            

CommBank is remunerated for InstalPay via a merchant service fee, a transaction fee that each merchant pays CommBank when a customer makes a purchase using InstalPay. Under our agreement with merchants, merchants are not able to pass this fee on to customers. This means CommBank can offer InstalPay to customers with no interest and no upfront or monthly account fees.
There are late fees if you don’t repay on time, and standard fees apply to your linked repayment account.


                            How are the monthly repayments calculated? 
                            

Your monthly repayment is simply the loan amount divided by the loan term. You pay no interest and no monthly or annual fees. For example: If you borrow $10,000 over a two-year loan term, your monthly repayment is $10,000 divided by 24 months = $416.67 (rounded up). It’s that simple.


                            Can I make extra repayments?
                            

Yes, you can make extra repayments or pay out your loan early without charge or penalty anytime via NetBank or the CommBank. Extra repayments aren’t available for redraw and will reduce your monthly repayment obligation for future payments. 


                            Something went wrong in my application – how do I re-apply for InstalPay?
                            

You can always resume your application for InstalPay via NetBank under ‘My applications’. Otherwise, you can return to the merchant checkout, select InstalPay and start the application again. 


                            How is payment for my purchase made?
                            

If approved, we’ll pay the merchant directly the amount of your purchase and then debit your InstalPay loan account. You’ll then pay us what you owe in monthly instalments over the agreed term. 


                            What do I do if my loan is unsuccessful? 
                            

We’ll let you know on the spot. At this point you’ll be redirected back to the merchant checkout page, where you can select another payment option if you wish to proceed with your purchase. 


                            What if something goes wrong with the products I’ve bought using InstalPay?
                            

If you have any questions or concerns regarding the goods and services you buy using InstalPay, you’ll need to contact the merchant directly. Using InstalPay to pay for your purchase won’t affect any rights you may have under applicable consumer protection laws. If you have concerns related to your InstalPay application or loan account, contact us.
