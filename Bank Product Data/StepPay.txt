How it works


StepPay is a digital only buy now, pay later product that can be added to your CommBank app or to the digital wallet on your smart phone, iPad or Android tablet. You can use StepPay to pay everywhere in-store, or online, up to your credit limit, without needing a physical card.
We’ll automatically split your purchases of $100 or more into four equal repayments. Your first repayment will come out of your linked CommBank account up to two days after the purchase is posted to your StepPay account. The following repayments will come out over the next three fortnights.
For purchases under $100, these are not installed and the full amount will come out of your linked CommBank account in one go, two days after the transaction is posted2 to your StepPay account. This means you can use the same card to also make small value transactions under $100. 
There are no interest charges, no monthly or annual fees, and you’ll be able to access your repayment schedule anytime in the CommBank app. Late payment fees will apply, but we have limits in place so fees are capped. Fees and charges may apply to your linked CommBank account.
To use StepPay, you’ll need to be eligible and a current customer, or if you’re a new customer, simply open an eligible CommBank account. For a full list of eligible linked CommBank repayment accounts, refer to the FAQs section below.
When you first set up a StepPay account, you’ll choose a limit that suits your needs. You can manage your spend limit at any time directly in the CommBank app, with the ability to move your limit up or down, subject to eligibility. We may reduce your spend limit*, we’ll notify you if we do. To manage your short-term budgeting needs, you can also apply a temporary spending cap.

FAQs


What is buy now, pay later?

Buy now, pay later products offer you the ability to split up purchases into smaller repayments so you can pay them off over time. With StepPay, you'll be able to split purchases of $100 or more into four fortnightly repayments. Smaller purchases under $100 will come out of your linked CommBank account in one go, two days after posting.
Who is eligible for StepPay?
StepPay is available to CommBank customers who meet our eligibility criteria and who satisfy credit assessments.
Something went wrong in my application, how do I apply for StepPay?
Jump into the CommBank app and search ‘StepPay’. Tap ‘StepPay’ and then tap ‘Apply now’ to see if you're eligible.
Why can't I activate my StepPay account?
If you try to activate your StepPay and get an error or something has gone wrong after your application, you can always try again by navigating to the ‘Cards’ section in the CommBank app.
It might take a bit of time to appear in the ‘Cards’ section so try again later on if you can’t see it straightaway.
I successfully activated StepPay in the CommBank app, but it isn’t showing within the StepPay repayments and transactions tabs. Instead it looks like a regular Credit Card. Is something wrong?
It's likely you're accessing StepPay on an old version of the CommBank app. Once you've downloaded the latest version of the CommBank app, you'll be able to view the correct StepPay screens.
Where can I use StepPay?
You can split your purchases of $100 or more into four equal repayments everywhere in-store and online. Whether it's paying for a weekend getaway, utility bills, yoga classes or those new shoes you have your eye on.
Do I pay fees or interest?
You don’t pay any account fees or interest. A late fee of $10 will apply if you miss a repayment, but there are caps in place to minimise the amount of additional fees charged. Fees and charges may apply to your linked CommBank repayment account.
What happens if I miss one of my StepPay repayments?
StepPay will automatically deduct the four repayments from your chosen linked transaction account.
If there aren't enough funds in the account, the card will be temporarily blocked until the funds are available.
I missed a StepPay repayment and now my card is blocked. What should I do?
If this happens, please don't transfer funds into StepPay. It's faster and easier to use the new PayNow feature to repay due or upcoming instalments.
If PayNow is unavailable on your CommBank app, make sure that the required funds are in your linked account
We’ll automatically check this account a few times a day and once cleared, your StepPay will be ready to use in 1-2 business days.
Can you repay instalments early?
Yes, the new PayNow feature on the CommBank app allows customers to repay upcoming instalments with the click of a button.
Can I change my StepPay limit?
Yes, you can move your spend limit up or down all in the CommBank app.
When moving your spend limit down, keep in mind if you wish to move it up in the future, you’ll need to reapply.
Moving your spend limit up is subject to eligibility.
You can also apply a temporary spending cap to manage your short-term budgeting needs. It’s a way to reduce how much you can spend, without permanently decreasing your overall spend limit. You can turn it on or off at any time, all in the CommBank app.
Is there a list of eligible CommBank repayment accounts for StepPay?

Initially, StepPay can only be linked to a CommBank transaction account. These eligible CommBank accounts include:
Business Transaction Account, Cash Investment Account, Cash Management Call Account, Cheque Account Bearing Interest, Cheque Account Not Bearing Interest, Complete Access, Everyday Offset, Premium Business Cheque Account, Private Banking Account, Smart Access, Streamline Basic Account.
Can you access CommBank Yello Cashback Offers with StepPay?
Yes. StepPay is eligible under the CommBank Yello Cashback Offers program.
What are the differences between StepPay and CommBank AdvancePay?
They are both CommBank products.
StepPay is the CommBank buy now pay later product.
CommBank AdvancePay is where you apply to access money you expect to be paid, before your next pay day.
