Things you should know


1 A Monthly Account Fee waiver applies if you’re under 30 years of age, or 30 and above and deposit at least $2,000 each calendar month (excludes Bank initiated transactions). You may also be eligible for a different Monthly Account Fee exemption if you have an aged, disability or war veterans pension deposited in your account, have a balance of $50,000 or more in eligible contributing accounts, are reliant on over-the-counter services because of a disability or have an eligible home loan.
2 Cardless cash is available from any CommBank ATM. Withdrawals are limited to a total of $500 per day. CommBank app, NetBank, NetCode and account access required. Full terms and conditions in the CommBank app.
3 Requires a GoalSaver or NetBank Saver in your name only.
4 The CommBank Yello Cashback Offers program (‘CommBank Yello Cashback Offers’) rewards you with cashback after you activate (where required) an offer presented to you via the CommBank app and you make a purchase in accordance with the Terms and Conditions of that offer. Cashback is typically received within 14 business days of a qualifying purchase, but in some cases may take longer. If you are not already enrolled, you can enrol if you are at least 18 years old, hold an eligible CommBank credit Mastercard or debit Mastercard, Business credit Mastercard or StepPay digital card, and meet the ‘Base eligibility criteria’ in the ‘CommBank Yello Terms and Conditions’ (latest version available on our website at commbank.com.au) (‘CommBank Yello’). Your participation in CommBank Yello Cashback Offers is governed by the full Terms and Conditions available in the CommBank app.
5 If you don’t have an existing transaction account to link to your NetBank Saver, then we’ll automatically open a Smart Access account for you when you open a NetBank Saver. Fees may apply to this account. Find out more about rates and fees.
6 We protect you from unauthorised transactions on personal and business accounts when you protect how you access your accounts and tell us if something is wrong. Tell me more.
7 We predict your bills based on patterns in your transactions, how much you pay and when. We may not predict all of your bills. Our prediction date and amounts may be different from your actual bill. Check your bills and due dates to avoid late fees or paying an incorrect amount. See 'Bills and payments' in the CommBank app Terms and Conditions for full details.
8 The recipient needs to have an Australian bank account (with BSB and account number) and have an active mobile phone number.
