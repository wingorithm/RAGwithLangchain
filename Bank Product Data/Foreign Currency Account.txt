                            Does CommBank accept foreign cheques?
                            

We no longer accept foreign cheques. You can receive payments from outside Australia directly into your account through an International Money Transfer.


                            How do I send money overseas?
                            

You can use an International Money Transfer to send money to:

Someone’s mobile number – it’s quick, easy and secure
Someone’s international bank account - you’ll need their full name, home address, account name, account number or International Bank Account Number (IBAN) and the SWIFT or Bank Identification Code (BIC) of their bank

Tip: convert your payment into foreign currency and send from NetBank or the CommBank app to lock in the exchange rate and pay a lower transfer fee


                            How long does it take to send money overseas? 
                            

An International Money Transfer takes around 3 business days to reach the recipient, but may take longer depending on the country and bank
IMTs made on a weekend, a public/bank holiday or after the currency cut-off time will be processed the following business day
You can trace an IMT if it hasn’t been received
